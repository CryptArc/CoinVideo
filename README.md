More Details 
------------------

This project was written to run on Google's App Engine platform.

**(Frontend)**

* Clean, simple interface.


* Auto-update user's balance using AJAX.

**(Backend)**

* Google's [Datastore](http://google.com) (*NoSQL*) for database

**NOTE:** This project is a complete and working website. That said, it's development has most likely
been discontinued. (I stopped using Virool, so have little interest in continuing development).
